## The Runnable god of instance creation and destruction.

Shiva is responsible for managing instances for Runnable's single-tenant build and run clusters (the realm of Acheron). Her primary responsibilities are:

1. To create build and run cluster instances on EC2 via [Amazon Machine Images](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)
2. To destroy unused build and run cluster images when instructed to do so.

While she currently only holds dominon over EC2, shiva will ultimately transcend AWS and become provider independent.
